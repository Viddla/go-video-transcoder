Go Video Transcoder - Govitra
=============================

Provides a simple API for uploading videos to be transcoded.

Note: This does not actually implement the serving part. You need some other server, for example Nginx,
to serve the uploaded content.

## API

The API is very simple and has only two endpoints, one for uploading and one for deleting.

### Uploading

`POST /uploads` with raw video data in body.

```json
{
    "video": "$host/$id.mp4",
    "thumbnail": "$host/$id.jpg",
    "deleteUrl": "$self/uploads/$id"
}
```
or
```json
{ "error": "Human readable error description" }
```

### Deleting

`DELETE /uploads/$id`

These URLs should not be made by hand as the ID is not a real thing,
but the URL can be retrieved from the upload JSON response `deleteUrl`

Returns `204 No Content`
or
```json
{ "error": "Human readable error description" }
```

## Production setup

#### Dependencies

- [avconv](https://libav.org/avconv.html) for transcoding
- [exiftool](http://owl.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/) for detecting video rotation

#### Environment variables

Govitra itself requires some amount of configuration to run, this is provided as environment variables.
It also requires a server to serve the actual video files. Note: You forbid the server from serving
`.owner` files as they are used to store who uploaded the video.

- Common:
    - `GOTR_TEMP_PATH`: Path to download and process videos in
    - `GOTR_SERVE_PATH`: Path to copy transcoded videos. _Needs_ to be in the same
    mount as `GOTR_TEMP_PATH` since the processed videos are renamed to here when done.
    - `GOTR_STORAGE_URL_PATH`: Base path appeneded to `GOTR_URI` or `LAYERS_API_URI`
    that serves files from `GOTR_SERVE_PATH`
    - `GOTR_API_URL_PATH`: Base path appended to `GOTR_UR` or `LAYERS_API_URI` that
    is used for the API calls
- Layers Box:
    - `LAYERS_API_URI`: URL of the box (should be predefined by Layers Box)
    - `AUTH_URL_PATH`: Path appended to `LAYERS_API_URI` for the authentication `/userinfo` endpoint
- Standalone:
    - `GOTR_URI`: URL of this server
    - `AUTH_URI`: URL of the authentication [OIDC `/userinfo` endpoint](http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#UserInfo)

### Example setup:

Dependencies and server:
```
apt-get update

# Golang (and git for 'go get')
apt-get install -y golang git

# Govitra dependencies
apt-get install -y libav-tools exiftool

# Download and build Govitra
go get github.com/bqqbarbhg/go-video-transcoder
```

Govitra environment:
```
GOTR_TEMP_PATH = /var/govitra-uploads/temp
GOTR_SERVE_PATH = /var/govitra-uploads/serve

GOTR_STORAGE_URL_PATH=/govitra-videos/
GOTR_API_URL_PATH=/govitra-api/

GOTR_URI=https://server.com
AUTH_URI=https://server.com/achrails/oidc/auth
```

Server configuration (nginx):
```
# Proxy the API to Govitra
location /govitra-api/ {
    client_max_body_size 0;
    proxy_pass http://localhost:8080/;
}

# Serve the uploaded files
location /govitra-videos/ {
    root /var/govitra-uploads/data;
    try_files $uri =404;

    # Deny .owner-files
    location ~ \.owner$ {
        deny all;
        return 404;
    }
}
```

Now the API should be hosted at `https://server.com/govitra-api/`
and videos at `https://server.com/govitra-videos/`

## Development setup

- Get the [production dependencies](#dependencies)
- Clone [achrails](https://github.com/learning-layers/achrails)
- Follow the [achrails development setup](https://github.com/learning-layers/achrails#development-setup)
- Clone this repository and `cd` into it
- Build Govitra: `go build`
- To run it for testing: `./test.sh`, this points Govitra to the default achrails address `http://10.11.12.13:9292`
- Go to `10.11.12.13:9292/oidc/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=client&redirect_uri=http://example.com` and authenticate using the Developer authentication
- After being redirected to `http://example.com?code=<CODE>` copy the `<CODE>`
- Request `POST http://10.11.12.13:9292/oidc/token` with `code=<CODE>&client_id=client&client_secret=secret&grant_type=authorization_code` and copy the access token
- Now you can do authenticated requests to `localhost:8080` using the header `Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS-TOKEN>`

## Development
